# LinkedIn-Automation
Creating an automated system that monitors competitors' LinkedIn activity, specifically targeting decision-makers' new connections. Based on the 'About Us' section, job description, or recent posts of these new connections, the automation should generate a hyper-personalized connection request to be sent from your LinkedIn account.

Steps:
1. Monitor Competitors' Activity: Build a function to track new connections of
competitor's decision makers. This involves understanding LinkedIn's API or
relevant scraping tools (always considering LinkedIn's Terms of Service and
privacy rules).
2. Analyze Connections' Profiles: Upon identifying a new connection, your script
should analyze their profile data, specifically the 'About Us' section, job
description, or recent posts.
3. Message Generation: Based on the analysis, the script should generate a
hyper-personalized connection request. Consider using Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques or other appropriate algorithms for this task.
4. Connection Request: The script should then send the connection request from
your LinkedIn account with the generated personalized message.
